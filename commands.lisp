 (long-description "Each (object . method) combination corresponds to several operators, which act in concert
 to implement the protocol:

 - `respond-to-_method_`   peforms the command on a client object in response to a broker message.
 This includes changes to instance state, open/close side effects for `connection` and `channel` methods,
 instantiating and binding, or releasing any related, as well as any requisite broker message responses
 as confirmation or as further processing.

 - `request-_method_`      issues the request to the broker, together with any client object operations
 required by the protocol.

 - `send-_method_`         encodes frames and performs transport-level operations to send the command to
 the broker. This delegates to protocol-specific methods, which encode the respective arguments, and to
 the network device operations for the network stream functions. 

 - no explicit receive operators are defined, as messages are self-describing and decoded accordingly. 
 Application code is writtein in terms of `command-case` or `command-loop` statements which dispatch based
 on received commands type.

  The `def-amqp-command` forms below define the protocol class and the generic method operators.
 The `:response` and `:request` clauses include methods as appropriate to whether both the broker and
 the client implement the operation. A `:request` clause automatically defined a `send-` operators.
 An additional (possibly blank) `:send` clause can be included if sending must be supported in addition to
 a complete command request.

  The respective respond-to and and request operators are implemented in two layers.
 The interface operator, which uses the elementary name, is implemented in terms of a second
 operator: `channel-respond-to-`, or `channel-request-`, which requires an additional initial argument,
 the `channel`. The delegation call interposes the respective `objects-channel` value as this initial
 argument. The specialized methods are defined with `amqp:channel` as the initial specialization.

 The interface architecture makes it possible for applications to alter the api behavior by specializing
 just the channel, just the protocol class, or both."))
