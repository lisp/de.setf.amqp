  (long-description "Device-level operations are managed by channel instances, which delegete in turn to
connection-wrapped tcp sockets. The AMQP standards permit this combination to behave in either of (at
least) two ways. On one hand, one can use all allowed protocoal variability and treat the socket
connection as a multiplexed multi-channel stream. In this mode each thread would instantiate its own
channel on the shared connection. On the other hand, is also possible to constrain the connection's use
to dedicate it to a single channel - and thereby to a single thread.

 The multiplexed mechanism sets a much lower demand for system resources, but increases the processing
for a single channel and constrains the i/o operations to block mode. A dedicated mechanims requires
more sockets, but can dedicate the buffering to a single thread, which permits more efficient i/o
operations.

 When the socket is multiplexed, then it is possible that content frames for one channel will be
interleaved with frames for another channel, which means it is not possible to guarantee that a given
socket read operation will contain an expected content frame. The multiplexing requires per-channel
queuing and processing upon delivery, whereby the actual buffer is not to be predicted. When the socket
is dedicated, read operatation can target a given buffer, since the intra-channel ordering constraints
require that content be delivered in-order and uninterrupted. The protocol meta-data can be read and
processed in-line ro parameterize the read and recognize exceptions, while data i/o targets given
buffers. The 1.0pr documentintroduces additional session and context for frame processing, but those are
not considered here. (see amqp0-8.pdf,p.56 amqp0-9.pdf,p.35)

 In the implementation below, the two amqp classes - connection and channel, are each specialized from
simple-stream and implement the standard interface. The required device operators are implemented for
both amqp:channel and amqp:connection, despite that stream operations are limited to channels while
connections are to be used only to consolidate frame-based operations with the network stream. The
principle operators are

    device-open (stream #-sbcl slots initargs)
    device-close (stream abort)
    device-read (stream buffer start end blocking)
    device-clear-input (stream buffer-only)
    device-write (stream buffer start end blocking)
    device-clear-output (stream)
    device-flush (device)
    device-read-content (device &rest content-arguments)
    device-write-content (device body &rest content-arguments)

 The device-open operator returns an instance which can be used directly. In the case of a channel, it
connects to the respective connection and prepares any exchange/queue specified in uri initialization
argument.  In that state it can be supplied to publish, consume, or get operations to initiate stream
i/o, or to transfer isolated objects. In the case of a connection, a socket stream is opened to the
designated server and the protocol handshake and open-connection phases are completed. (see
open-connection and negotiate-client-connection) In that state, one can construct and use channels. In the
case of a connection, it should be used only to make channels. Note that the connection class is adjusted to
match that of the protocol version which it negotiates with the remote broker. That is, a

    (make-instance 'amqp:connection  :uri \"amqp://guest:guest@localhost/\")

will return a connection sub-class. This places constraints on the effective methods for `device-open` and the
various constituents of the standard instantiation protocol for `simple-stream`.
The respective effective methods for the base implementation look something like

    initialize-instance : (CONNECTION) (STANDARD-OBJECT)
    shared-initialize (in mcl) : (CONNECTION T) (AMQP-DEVICE T) :AFTER (SIMPLE-STREAM T) (STANDARD-OBJECT T)
    reinitialize-instance : (STANDARD-OBJECT)
    device-open (in sbcl) : (CONNECTION T) (AMQP-SOCKET-DEVICE T) (AMQP-DEVICE T) (SIMPLE-STREAM T) (SLOT-OBJECT T)

The exact form depends on the run-time (cf. `standard-object` v/s `sloto-object`), but all share the topology,
that no next method call follows the class change. Should protocol-specific specialization be necessary, any
specialized operation subsequent to the change would need to be independent of these effective methods.

 The device-read and device-write operators are defined at the respective levels to delegate a channel's
operations to the respective connection and to perform connection i/o through the socket stream. When
channel operations  with an explicit buffer, are intended to implement data stream-based data transfer
for a channel which has already initiated a message exchange and observe the body size constraints
specified fro the message. Where the size is known at the outset, the body-size and body-position govern
eof behaviour. Where the size was unkown, the channel implemented chunked transfer in terms of maxmial
sized messages, and relies on device-flush and device-clear-input to indicate and manage the effective
eof.

 The channels position operators track the position during stream read/write operations only. They combine
the frame position with the current buffer position to yield the byte offset in the effective stream.
The device-read/write-content operators reset the position and subsequent body frame read/write operators
accumulate the last frame's buffer size.
For connections, the frame position accumulates the start position of all frames (including header frames)
as they are read and written over the connection, but neither accounts for partial buffer lengths nor
distinguishes between header and body frames. (see read/write-frame)
The position operators have no effect on channel state.

as well as the discussions of the the alternative fu interface.[5]

 DEVICE : amqp:channel : an open channel
 COMPLETE : boolean : iff true, this is the final flush on a stream of messsages. if the channel was
  sending chunks, send an additional final marker message.

 Given a buffer, its content is passed through the channel's
 frame buffers. Lacking a buffer, the exisitng frame buffer is sent. The effect is to support
 single-frame commands, sequence-based stream io, and buffer based stream io. The device state is checked to
 confirm an operation makes sense.

 On framed content, streams, and chunking:
 there are three aspects:
 * is there buffered content: (zerop outpos) ?
 * is the content complete?
 * was the content length known ahead of time: .output or .output.chunked ?

 if there is content, wrap up the body frame and send it.
 given the now empty buffer, if the content body is now complete, then it matters whether the length was
 predetermined. if it was, that is, in state .output (which includes .output.chunked), since this is not an
 abort, sufficient frames must be sent to achieve the content length.if the state is .output.chunked, the end
 of the sequence of commands is indicated by sending an additional zero-length message."

implemented by open-connection. It negotiates with the broker to agree on a supported protocol version

some protocol versions, it is also confronted with the initial frame, which it buffers for the
configuration step.

 The second step, authentication and configuration, is implemented in negotiate-client-connection. It
exchanges connection commands with the broker for authentication and tuning. The configured connection is

(:documentation (device-read-content device-write-content)
  "The content processing interface comprises the two operators
  * device-read-message (channel &rest)
  * device-write-message (channel body &rest)

 Each accepts the keywords which apply to the respective protocol operation, that is, any method arguments and the class'
 header properties. for reading this means the arguments for get and deliver, while for writing those for publish.
 The interface supports two use patterns : body instances and continuation based. The decision is made by the writer
 according to whether the body size is known at the outset. For fixed length vectors this is true. For aeverything else, it
 is not. Where it is known, a single content-bearing command is sent. Where is it not known, A sequence of commands is
 sent until the writer terminates the stream by indicating completion in a call to device-flush.

 Streams are broken into and reconstituted from the three frame constituents for a command : method, header, and body.
 * a method frame : is emitted by a request operator and parsed and processed by the respond-to- operator to cache the
   arguments in the channel. The protocol interface operator then invokes device-read/write-content.
 * a content header : ion inpt, s parsed in device-read-content/content-header to extract the properties and cache them
   in the channel's basic class instance. On output, it is generated by device-write-content based on the channel's current
   basic instance
 * the content body : is parsed based on the channel's internal type combined with the content type. It is generated
   based on the bassed body instance in combination with the content type /encoding.
