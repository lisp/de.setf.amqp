  (long-description
   "Each AMQP protocol version presents a particular model for message processing. At
 the same time, despite the variations, all message-level models distinguish
 between 'class' and 'operator' entities, and the transport-level models all
 concern exchanges of 'framed' data through 'connections'. At the message
 level the classes exhibit various relations - either connection/channel/class
 or connection/session/channel/links/class, while operators are termed variously
 'methods', 'commands', and 'controls'. at the same time, their specialized roles do not affect
 their basic representation. All are 'classes' on an abstract level. The distinction
 is of a containment hierarchy.

 At the transport level, transported data is broken into various constituents -
 either 'content' and 'frames' or 'assemblies', 'segments' and 'frames', but
 this does not affect the respective representation either.

 This implementation reflects the following general order.

 1. The primary interface classes are amqp:object and amqp:method. These are specialized in terms
 of protocol version, and  according to the respetive protocol's functional model. In terms of the
 protocols' taxonometric class hierarchy - eg, for 0.8r0, 0.9r1, this manifests in the class definitions
 and their relations:
    connection (1)--
      -- (*) channel (1) ---
               --(*) access basic cluster dtx exchange file link queue stream tx
   with each class associated with the respective methods, eg.
      CHANNEL : OPEN OPEN-OK FLOW FLOW-OK CLOSE CLOSE-OK
      EXCHANGE : DECLARE DECLARE-OK DELETE DELETE-OK
   (See the version's respective classes.lisp)

 2. At the transport level, each protocol's model is reflected in the
 data containers - eg channel, content, assembly, segment, link, and frame.

 3. At the wire level each protocol version specifies encoding rules and
 how to map its defined data types to lisp data.

 This file defines the abstract classes, the 'commands' file implements the
 protocol logic in terms of them, and the 'data-wire-encoding' file defines the
 general data codecs. Each protocol is implemented in three files in the
 eponymous directory:
  'data-wire-encoding' : defines codecs in terms of the protocol's type domain names
    which are used in the protocol operators. Compound codecs - eg, map,
    array, and list, require version-specific type codes.
  'abstract-classes'   : defines the protocol-specific abstract classes.
  'classes'            : defines codecs for the concrete classes and methods."))

 associates a decoder with the frame and then delegates to parsing functions to extract the constituent
 details. The initial association is with abstract singletons which belong to htbased on frame type
 singletons based on the frame class and method codes. Once parsing proceeds, methods
 are decimaed into keywords and the class is replaced with a channel-specific instance
 which can cache the of the frame content. In the case of content bodies, however, no replacement
 is necessary, as the body passes through the processing tree opaquely."))
